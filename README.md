## Documentation

You need a working LaTeX distribution in order to build the specifications document.
If you decide to use the `make specs` command to compile, be aware that the `latexmk` binary needs to be in your `$PATH`.

This quick fix may work for you: `export PATH=/Library/TeX/texbin/:$PATH`
