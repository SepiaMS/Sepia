# How to contribute

Our working environment is Mac OS X _El Capitan_ (10.11). The specifications are written in LaTeX, using **MacTeX**.

## Getting started

- Install an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your editor.
- Setup your encoding (editor, terminal, etc.) to UTF-8.

## Version control

- Prefer frequent, short commits.
- Use `git fetch` often.
- If a `git merge` happens, flatten the history with `git rebase origin/master`.
- Keep your commit messages short (pref. below 50 characters).
- Use the imperative, present tense: i.e. use “change”, not “changed” or “changes”.
- Do NOT push an uncompilable code onto `master`.
